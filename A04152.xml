         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Upon week daies, when you have any lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular imployments, you spend it in reading of Gods Booke, and the bookes of Holy men, tending to piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: And that every morning and evening, you not onely offer up unto God the sacrifice
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20045:32"/>of praise and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for all his benefit bestowed upon you, begging withall, a wise &amp; understanding heart to perform the duties of your calling to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, your Masters profit, and the comfort of your own conscience; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that you commend your selfe, your affaires, and all that you have relation unto, to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull providence, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and protection.</p>

                  <p>But in any case doe not thinke you have performed your duty towards God suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently when you have said your prayers in private, and heard the Word of God in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, unlesse your heart be set upon the practice of those graces you pray for, and are exhorted unto by the Word of God. You must labour to be so indeed, as you professe your selfe to be, and would have men thinke you are: For the praise of a circumcised
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20045:33"/>heart is not of men, but of God. And it is one of Gods peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties to discerne and know the thoughts and intentions of all mens hearts.

Take heed therefore of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; shewes of piety without substance, is abominable in his eyes.</p>

                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:20045:36"/> 2. <hi>Of Chastity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second vertue you are to preserve in your selfe is Chastity, which extends as well to the minde, keeping it void of unchaste cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, consent, motion, or any manner of lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious purpose; as to the body, restrayning all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy speech, words and actions that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holy Will of God. S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it thus. This is the Will of God,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.3, 4, 5.</note> even your san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, that you should abstaine from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20045:37"/>fornication, That every one of you should know how to possesse his ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in sanctification and honour, Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God.</p>
                  <p>To the end then that you may endeavour to performe this duty; consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God hath made a promise of love and favour to all those that doe so.</p>
                  <p>Seeing we have these promises (to wit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> that God will receive us, and be a father unto us, and wee shall be his sonnes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20045:37"/>and daughters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18.) let us cleanse our selves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of the flesh and spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Inordinate lusts and affections (if you entertaine them) will make head and fight against your soule. Hence is that exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.11.</note> Deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstaine from fleshly lusts, which fight against the soule.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That if they be not cast out, they will serve as a foundation for Satan to build his,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20045:38"/>strong holds upon w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> nothing but the mighty power of God can throw down. They will hinder the efficacy of the Word. They will weaken your trust on the grace of God. And in the end they will bring you to shame in this world, and to endlesse misery in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, as you desire to live in the love and favour of God, to be freed from a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous enemy of your soule: to hinder Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan from building his strong holds in your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20045:38"/>heart, possesse your ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in holinesse and chastity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Of Contentment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third vertue is contentednesse in your present cōdition, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ought to be pleased with that estate wherein you are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. This is that vertue which S. <hi>Paul</hi> learned of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. And this is that I desire you should learne of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in rhe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. saith, Let
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20045:39"/>every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</p>
                  <p>To this end consider, that the calling you are placed in, was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you by Gods particular providence, as knowing better what was fit for you then you your selfe.</p>
                  <p>To be discontented therefore with your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is to repine at Gods Providence, which is a cursed effect, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either,
<list>
                        <item>1. From envie: or,</item>
                        <item>2. From ambition: or,</item>
                        <item>3. From impatience.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From envie, when a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20045:39"/>man grieves to see him, that was sometimes his equall or inferiour, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (to outward seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in a more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, eminent, or easie course of life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From ambition, when a man thinking better of himselfe then there is cause, falls into dislike with his present estate, and by all the meanes and friends hee can make, seekes for a calling of more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From impatience, when a man meeting with crosses &amp; troubles in the affaires incident
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20045:40"/>to his imployments, and being not able to brook them, resolves to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish his place, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to live in another calling, which is ill; or in no calling, with is worse.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore be your care to shut the dore of your heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these evill guests, envie, ambition, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver else tends to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in your present condition, esteeming al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that calling best for you, wherin by Gods providence you are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>

If (in the pride of their hearts) they conceit the thing commanded be not agreeable to their birth or breeding, they will either not doe it at all; or if they doe, it will be so unseasonably, and in so ill a manner, as it would have beene better they had never meddled with it.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20045:60"/>conscience, because God hath commanded them, and not onely out of hope of reward, or feare of punishment.</p>
                  <p>This is that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God requires to be performed in his worship, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.13. Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.

Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not with fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of God wee have had our conversation in the world.</p>
                  <p>The soule of this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the practice of holy duties is humility which will discover it selfe three waies.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my advice is this, that in any case you give not over the trade, and betake your selfe to some other calling or course of life, as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of discontent or selfe-willednesse have done, to the utter ruine of their estates; but if your meanes will not fall out answerable to your minde, you must labour to frame your mind according to your meanes. And therefore,

And all the while you are in this condition, be sure that

               <p>But if you have such helpe from your friends as shall inable you to set up for your selfe, and to be your owne Master, then doe so in the name of God, and in such a manner as is usuall to men of your calling.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids servants obey their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in all things.

If the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded doe evidently appeare to be wicked, then know, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to disobey your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster than offend God: but in refusing to obey, you must take heed of sturdy and insolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of provoking
